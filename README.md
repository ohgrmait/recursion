  Fibonacci and Merge Sort via Recursion
</div>

## About
`recursion` is a project where I tackle two classic problems that leverage recursion: the Fibonacci Series and the Merge Sorting Algorithm.[^1]

[^1]: [This project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-recursion) is from the [Ruby Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby) in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).


## Technologies
- ***Git***
- ***CLI***
- ***Ruby***
- ***GitHub***

## Setup & Usage

### Setup
- The Ruby version for this project 3.3.5.
- `bundle install` installs the gems locally.
- `bundle exec ruby [filename]` runs the file.

### Usage
- For local use, users can either [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) and/or [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repo, or
  - `bundle install` and `bundle exec ruby main.rb` to play the game.

## Self Reflections
- > This was not easy by any means. I had to refer to other resources and videos to come up with a solution mainly because, after much deliberation, I thought that there is no point in reinventing the wheel. The sources that I used are mentioned below - what's even crazy is that despite coming up with the code, understanding and tracing the answer manually was incredibly annoying and difficult. Nonetheless, I made good use of the debugger to walk (or trace) through both of these problems comprehensively.
